    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people might tell you that you don't need to learn awk, despite the naysayers I have used it many times and not many people are any good at it, but not you - you will not be one of those sad people who ask me to write their awks, you can write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a 2 million line log file and you very quickly need to get out the 3rd and 85th column and you only want lines that end with x and start with y, and you have 10 seconds to achieve this when you are SSH'd into a remote server. That's where awk will be most useful. While other folk are speaking about how they can split the file up to open it in Excel, you'll be off for lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what actually is [awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK), it was invented by three computer scientists and each of their last names are a, w, and k. The original awk was written for the Unix operating system but we will be using the Debian implementation of awk, named mawk. A Debian package maintainer wrote a faster and more efficient version of awk and he was called Mike, that's why it's called mawk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides an introduction to the programming language awk. There is an advanced tutorial [here](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) if you would like to learn more about. I would also recommend the [O'Reilly Sed & Awk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/sed-awk-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/0596003528) pocket reference book.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structure of awk programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Awk programs often follow the structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts with a begin block, this is the start of the program using the keyword `BEGIN`:\n",
    "\n",
    "BEGIN {commands}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is usually some kind of pattern which is between /pattern/\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is an `END` block\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate awk in action in Jupyter, click File > New > Text File, copy with CTRL+C then paste the following into the text file. Click File > Save Text As, and save it as pings.txt, this is just a basic file we can use to practice. We have some log data on pings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1)  R1   S1  11\n",
    "2)  R1   S2  20\n",
    "3)  S3   S4  14\n",
    "4)  D1   D2  16\n",
    "5)  A5   S1  26\n",

    "1. First we say awk - to tell the computer we are using awk - _obviously_ ;)\n",
    "2. Then open quotes to start the program and write `BEGIN`\n",
    "3. Next we start the pattern with {}, and say print with `printf`\n",
    "4. Double quotes then say what we want to print adding `\\n` to the end to add a new line\n",
    "5. Close } and then add `{print}` to the end and close quotes, then add the filename"
